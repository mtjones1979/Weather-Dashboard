## Obstacles 

My plan was to try to create this app using standard JavaScript instead of Jquery.  I realized there was a learning curve.  I was not able to call the API correctly at first but leaned on my TA Walter Perry and he lead me in the right direction. The project will be finished soon, though, I feel like I have learned alot with all of my trials and errors.
